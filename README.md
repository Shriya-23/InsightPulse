💬 InsightPulse

-By simply uploading a CSV file of reviews, the app instantly analyzes tone (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) and visualizes key trends through interactive charts.

-The name InsightPulse comes from the idea of feeling the pulse of user feedback:Capturing insights in real time to understand what users truly feel about a product.

🧠 Why I Built This

-During my 6th semester, I noticed how companies often collect tons of user feedback but struggle to interpret it quickly.

-So I built InsightPulse: A lightweight tool that translates raw text into data-driven insights within seconds.

🔹Problems InsightPulse Solves

-Scattered User Feedback: Companies collect thousands of reviews across platforms but struggle to quickly analyze what users actually feel.

-Slow Decision-Making: Product managers and consultants often rely on manual reading or external tools, delaying response to user sentiment trends.

-Lack of Actionable Insights: Traditional reports show data, not emotions — InsightPulse converts raw text into clear sentiment-driven insights.

-No Lightweight Solution: Existing analytics tools are complex or paid; InsightPulse is a simple, open-source solution that gives real-time understanding of customer mood.
